/** First-run readiness truth (D01). Saved is not ready:
 * - runtime needs the CLI present AND a verified version (an unsupported
 *   runtime fails every dispatch, so reporting it ready strands new users);
 * - connection stays connected-based (probing model access on every poll
 *   would spend allowance and hit the network; the Test button owns that);
 * - a teammate only counts with a provider assignment whose model belongs
 *   to that connection (an unconfigured or post-delete teammate cannot run).
 * Pure: every branch is unit-testable with fixed inputs. */
